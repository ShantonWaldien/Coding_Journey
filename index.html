          <p>This far we have only covered the HTML module. So we have covered from the basics such as web architecture , HTML glossary , < p > tags , < h > tags etc, to the more advacned stuff such as nested tables (which was quite a struggle ), validating forms, links etc. It has been very interesting this far and I look forward to starting with CSS soon.
